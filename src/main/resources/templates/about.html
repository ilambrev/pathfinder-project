            <p>We are Lucho and Chocho. We love nature and we walk very much, so we decided to create a place where people with similar interests can share roads, photos, videos, and comments. So, when a person manages to break away even for a day from the hectic daily life, he will be able to easily find a place to spend a few really energizing hours.</p>
